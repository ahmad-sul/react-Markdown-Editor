  A README is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. README files typically include information on:
  
  -   What the project does
  -   Why the project is useful
  -   How users can get started with the project
  -   Where users can get help with your project
  -   Who maintains and contributes to the project
  
  If you put your README file in your repository's root,  ${`docs`}, or hidden  ${`.github`}  directory, GitHub will recognize and automatically surface your README to repository visitors.`
